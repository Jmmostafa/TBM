abstract = {One aim of post-crisis monetary policy has been to ease credit conditions for borrowers by unlocking bank lending. We find that bank equity is an important determinant of both the bank's funding cost and its lending growth. In a cross-country bank-level study, we find that a 1 percentage point increase in the equity-to-total assets ratio is associated with a four basis point reduction in the cost of debt financing and with a 0.6 percentage point increase in annual loan growth. These findings suggest that greater retention of bank earnings and hence higher bank capital would have aided the transmission of accommodative monetary policy to ease financial conditions faced by ultimate borrowers. In particular, we find that the effects of a monetary tightening are smaller for banks with higher capitalization, which have easier access to uninsured financing. These results suggest that if the banking system as a whole is weakly capitalized, there may be some tension between the monetary policy imperative of unlocking bank lending (i.e., expanding credit) and the supervisory objective of ensuring the soundness of individual banks (i.e., shrinking credit).},

@article{Berrospide2010,
abstract = {The effect of bank capital on lending is a critical determinant of the linkage between financial conditions and real activity, and has received especial attention in the recent financial crisis. We use panel-regression techniques—following Bernanke and Lown (1991) and Hancock and Wilcox (1993, 1994)—to study the lending of large bank holding companies (BHCs) and find small effects of capital on lending. We then consider the effect of capital ratios on lending using a variant of Lown and Morgan's (2006) VAR model, and again find modest effects of bank capital ratio changes on lending. These results are in marked contrast to estimates obtained using simple empirical relations between aggregate commercial-bank assets and leverage growth, which have recently been very influential in shaping forecasters' and policymakers' views regarding the effects of bank capital on loan growth. Our estimated models are then used to understand recent developments in bank lending and, in particular, to consider the role of TARP-related capital injections in affecting these developments. ∗E-m},

abstract = {Bank capital ratios have increased steadily since the financial crisis. For a sample of 101 large banks from advanced and emerging economies, retained earnings account for the bulk of their higher risk-weighted capital ratios, with reductions in risk weights playing a lesser role. On average, banks continued to expand their lending in real terms, though lending contracted among European banks. Lower dividend payouts and (for advanced economy banks) wider lending spreads have contributed to banks' ability to use retained earnings to build capital. Banks that came out of the crisis with higher capital ratios and stronger profitability were able to expand lending more.},

@article{Saiz2018,
abstract = {The purpose of this article is to quantify how bank capital determines the effects of monetary policy on bank lending. Additionally, we test how these effects differ during monetary contractions and expansions. Using a sample of 3,028 European banks between 1999 and 2012, we find that the reduction in loans caused by monetary restrictions is similar across banks regardless of their capital. In addition, during monetary expansions, banks increase their loan supply more as they become better capitalized. Contrary to previous studies, there are differences in the monetary policy transmission through capital only during expansionary monetary regimes. These results are relevant because previous studies have not measured how the marginal effect of monetary policy on the growth of loans varies with the value of capital. We contribute to the existing literature by using a new approach that quantifies this marginal effect, which considerably improves the interpretation of statistical results from models that include continuous variable interactions and allows a better understanding of the role of bank capital in the transmission of monetary shocks.},

abstract = {Following the investment-cash flow literature, we test whether bank lending is constrained by the availability of insured deposits - a necessary condition for the existence of a bank lending channel of monetary policy. We treat insured deposits as a type of "internal fund," similar to cash flows. We use a simple model to sort out the possible identification issues in interpreting the correlation between lending and deposit growth, including reverse causality and omitted-variable bias. To minimize the latter, we control for loan demand; we use Tobin's Q and other proxies. We also split the sample by capital ratios under the assumption that the frictions facing banks in capital markets should be most severe for poorly capitalized banks. The results are consistent with the existence of frictions in capital markets facing banks, and show that such frictions forge a link between the supply of bank loans and the supply of insured deposits. The frictions seem to matter only at small banks, suggesting that the potential for a bank lending channel is limited.},

abstract = {This paper examines the role of bank capital in monetary policy transmission in India during the post-global financial crisis period. Empirical results show that banks with higher capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) raise funds at a lower cost. Additionally, banks with higher CRAR transmit monetary policy impulses smoothly, while stressed assets in the banking sector hinder transmission. Recapitalization to raise CRAR can improve transmission; however, CRAR above a certain threshold level may not help as the sensitivity of loan growth to monetary policy rate reduces for banks with CRAR above the threshold. Therefore, it can be concluded that monetary policy can influence the credit supply of banks depending on their capital position. JEL Classification: E44, E51, E52},

abstract = {Recent studies examining the effects of a credit rating on firms' capital structure and adjustment of capital structure to target have focused predominantly on non-financial firms, with virtually no attention given to financial institutions. Using an international sample of 391 rated banks from 76 countries, this study examines the effects of credit ratings on the capital structure of banks. We find that, on average, banks near a credit rating upgrade have a higher capital to assets ratio compared to banks not near a rating upgrade. Most systematically important “too-big-to-fail” banks near a credit rating upgrade tend to have lower capital relative to assets than the rest of the banks in our sample. Furthermore, banks downgraded from an investment-grade rating to a speculative-grade rating, on average, hold 1 (3) percentage points less capital relative to assets in the short (long) run. Contrary to studies based on non-financial firms, our results show that credit ratings have relatively little economic effect on the speed at which banks' capital is adjusted. Our results suggest that while rating agencies exert influences on banks' capital structure, they are fewer in number and tend to be weaker, compared to those documented in non-financial firms.},

abstract = {We investigated whether in recent years banks have increased their holdings of securities at the expense of their holdings of business loans in response to shortfalls of their capital relative to risk‐weighted capital standards and relative to a capital standard that made no explicit allowance for credit risk. We estimated that bank credit fell by about {\$}4.50 for each {\$}1 that a bank's capital fell short of the unweighted capital standard. Banks that had less capital than required by the risk‐weighted standard appear to have shifted away from assets with low risk weights (securities and single‐family mortgages) and to have shifted toward assets with higher risk weights (commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans). When we included both shortfall variables in a regression, shortfalls relative to the unweighted capital standard significantly affected bank credit, while shortfalls of capital relative to the risk‐weighted standard did not. We found no significant effects of capital shortfalls at other, local‐competitor banks on bank portfolios. Delinquencies in a given category of a bank's loans generally had significantly negative effects on that bank's holdings of loans in that category. In contrast, banks tended to increase holdings of loans in categories in which local‐competitor banks were experiencing higher delinquency rates. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract = {Do external imbalances increase the risk of financial crises? This paper studies the experience of 14 developed countries over 140 years (1870-2008). It exploits the long-run data set in a number of different ways. First, the paper applies new statistical tools to describe the temporal and spatial patterns of crises and identifies five episodes of global financial instability in the past 140 years. Second, it studies the macroeconomic dynamics before crises and shows that credit growth tends to be elevated and short-term interest rates depressed relative to the natural rate in the run-up to global financial crises. Third, the paper shows that recessions associated with crises lead to deeper slumps and stronger turnarounds in imbalances than during normal recessions. Finally, the paper asks to what extent external imbalances help predict financial crises. The overall result is that credit growth emerges as the single best predictor of financial instability. External imbalances have played an additional role, but more so in the pre-WWII era of low financialization than today.},
